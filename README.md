# Snake++ by DillyzThe1
A C++ recreation of "Snake" to learn about C++ game development and libraries.<br>
Made with the intent to learn and without any intent to make profit.
### Playing
Download a release build <a href="https://github.com/DillyzThe1/snake-plus-plus/releases/latest">here</a> and run it. (or, <a href="https://github.com/DillyzThe1/snake-plus-plus#compiling">compile it yourself</a>.)<br>
*NOTE: ONLY FOR WINDOWS!!!!*<br>
<br>
If you want more C++ projects like this, please leave suggestions on my Discord server!<br>
(yes ik it's called a modding lounge but i really don't care)
### Compiling
First, make sure you have <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/#visual-studio-2019-and-other-products">Visual Studio 2019</a> installed.<br>
Then, download this project with the "code" button or by cloning the repository.<br>
*NOTE: You may clone the repo by using `git clone https://github.com/DillyzThe1/snake-plus-plus`*<br>
Now open the SLN file in Visual Studio 2019.<br>
Download <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/">SFML 2.5.1</a> for c++15 in x64 or x32, depending on whichever you prefer. (I'm using x64, so I recommend that.)<br>
Put it in a folder somewhere to keep your libraries. I recommend storing SFML in `C:\cpp-libs\x64\SFML` & `C:\cpp-libs\x32\SFML`, which will avoid some steps.<br>
If you haven't put them in `C:\cpp-libs\x(64 or 32 bit)\SFML`, make sure to check the properties of the program.<br>
Now, drag the dlls from the bin of your SMFL install into `snake++/snake++/dlls/x64` so that they run with the game.
Finally, hit the green arrow and start debugging!
