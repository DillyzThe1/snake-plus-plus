# Version 1.1
## v1.1.0 (IN DEVELOPMENT)
* More simple compilation instructions and setup.
* The `rand_int()` function uses `getrand()` instead of it's own random seed.
* The function `getrand()` uses the old `rand_int()` generation and returns it for reuse.
* Better regeneration for the snake.
* Rendering has been moved to it's own `render()` function rather than being embedded in `while (window.isOpen())`.
* Moved icon loading below apple & snake head generation.
* Icon loading fail has a new warning pop up with instructions.
* You may now hit `I` to open the <a href="https://github.com/DillyzThe1/snake-plus-plus/issues">issues page</a>.
* The executable now uses the correct icon.
* You may drop your SMFL DLLs inside of `snake++/snake++/dlls/x64/` & have the move themselves.
* Shows the console on debug builds only.
